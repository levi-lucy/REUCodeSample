# REUCodeSample
The code found here was used in the 2017 Math Ecology REU at UWL. 
It was primarily used in conjunction with data from the Breeding Bird Survey (https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/rawdata/). The beginning half (commented out) requires some data files not included, but that section was used to import the raw data and format it for mathematical use. The second half pulls in included files, and shows that there are many locations in the United States with similar bird populations which are located in different conservation regions.
